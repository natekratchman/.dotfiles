### Phase 1: Document Analysis and Planning

1. **Read Input Document**

   - Use Read tool to examine the work document
   - Identify all deliverables and requirements
   - Note any constraints or dependencies
   - Extract success criteria

2. **Create Task Breakdown**

   - Convert requirements into specific tasks
   - Add implementation details for each task
   - Include testing and validation steps
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

3. **Build Todo List**
   - Use TodoWrite to create comprehensive list
   - Set priorities based on dependencies
   - Include all subtasks and checkpoints
   - Add documentation and review tasks

### Phase 2: Systematic Execution

1. **Task Execution Loop**

   ```
   while (tasks remain):
     - Select next task (priority + dependencies)
     - Mark as in_progress
     - Execute task completely
     - Validate completion
     - Mark as completed
     - Update progress
   ```

2. **Quality Assurance**

   - Run tests after each task
   - Execute lint and typecheck commands
   - Verify no regressions
   - Check against acceptance criteria
   - Document any issues found

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Regularly update task status
   - Note any blockers or delays
   - Create new tasks for discoveries
   - Maintain work visibility
